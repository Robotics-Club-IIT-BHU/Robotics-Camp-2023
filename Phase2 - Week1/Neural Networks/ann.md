# Neural Networks
So far you have learned about Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. 
* `Linear Regression` deals with the regression problem where you have to predict the value of something which can be any value on real number line.
* On the other hand, `Logistic Regression` deals with the classification problem, where you have to predict the correct class among number of classes, technically Logistic Regression is for binary classification but it's extension `Softmax Regression` deals with varying number of classes.

Neural Networks are different class of set of algorithms which in general deals with problems like classification. It's a huge field of study in iself and are the building blocks of what we know as Deep Learning. So let's embark on a journey of exploring and understanding Neural Networks and Deep Learning in general.

## Problem with Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a fantastic algorithm for the classification problem, but it's a `linear classifier`.<br> 

What do we mean by a linear classifier ?<br>
* A linear classifier achieves it's aim by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics. Thus, they are limit to the data which are only linearly separable.

You may recall in logistic regression we calculate our input as:
