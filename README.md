# Robotics-Camp-2023

Hello all !! Are you ready to embark on an extraordinary learning journey this summer? 🥵

Join us this summer for an extraordinary experience like no other. The Robotics Club IIT BHU is proud to present its highly anticipated Summer Camp, where young minds will be nurtured, skills will be honed, and creativity will soar to new heights.

In two dynamic phases, we will take you on a thrilling ride through the fascinating world of robotics. 

🤖 Phase 1, spanning for about three weeks, will lay the foundation for your technical prowess of Pybullet (a beginner-friendly simulator) and ROS (helps researchers and developers build and reuse code between robotics applications along with various path localization and mapping techniques) .

🤖 Phase 2, an equally enthralling three-week journey, will build upon the knowledge gained in the first phase along with implementation of SolidWorks: Comprehensive Design and Assembly Techniques along with concepts of Deep Learning .

Some extra related stuff will be added as the camp advances forwards.

🎯 But that's not all! On completion of the two phases, you will have the opportunity to work on an exhilarating project, where you can apply all that you have learned throughout the camp. Collaborate with fellow enthusiasts, brainstorm innovative ideas, and develop your innovation with the hardware accessories under the guidance of our esteemed mentors.

# Phase-1 :

In phase 1, we will be covering two important concepts firstly intro to concepts related to simulation software, i.e., Pybullet (where you will be performing all of your simulations required throughout the camp and ahead) followed with an introduction to ROS (Robot operating system ) along with its use-cases in various robot operating and handling tasks, we will also be introducing you with various other algorithms, being frequently used in various robotics related stuff.

We expect you to go through the content one by one, if you are stuck somewhere, google it, or else you can reach out to us. Complete the tasks at the end of each part and try to submit before the deadline :)

Feel this is going one way?? Don't worry, you can put up your queries on the whatsapp grp (Summer_camp_2023) , or do general chit-chat there. Your seniors (i.e., us 😌) will be available there. Discussing with peers, how they are progressing, also helps to do the task.

As ROS runs perfectly in the Linux operating system(Ubuntu_20.04) so it's necessary for every one of you to dual boot your system (you can also use a virtual machine to use Ubuntu under Windows but it requires good requirements of ram (12-16 GB preferable) to run smoothly), followed with setting up your ROS and Pybullet environments as suggested in the installation guide. This installation guide contains everything from scratch, still if you have some doubts , don't hesitate to ping any one of us through the whatsapp grp .
