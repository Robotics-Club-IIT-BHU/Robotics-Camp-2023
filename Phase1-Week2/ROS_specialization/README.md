*__Welcome to the ROS specialization by Robotics Club, IIT(BHU) Varanasi. We Aim to deliver a Beginner Level of Understanding to ROS to get you started with projects so Get ready to dive into the thrilling world of Robot Operating System (ROS) – the ultimate brain behind our mechanical pals! ROS is the secret sauce that brings robots to life, turning them into your very own loyal sidekicks. With ROS, you'll unlock a world of endless possibilities and become the master of your own robot army. So, put on your lab coat and get ready to unleash the power of ROS – let the robotic revolution begin!__*


## What is ROS

___ROS(Robot Operating System) is a software framework to enable communication, data flow, and suitable infrastructure development for a hardware-software system (robotics being the best application).
Oh, wait! It is also technically not an operating system. ROS is an OS only in concept because it provides all the services that any other OS does — hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementationof commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. But, ROS is a framework on top of the OS that allows it to abstract the hardware from the software. This means you can think in terms of software for all the hardware of the robot.
And that’s good news for you because this implies that you can actually create programs for robots without having to deal with the hardware. Cool right!___


 ## what all we will cover
 * ROS communication
 * RVIZ and Gazebo
 * Mapping and Localisation, SLAM
 * Creating a Catkin workspace and writing a node in python 


NOTE: ***We recommand you to look up [ros wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation) and [ros answers](https://answers.ros.org/questions/) as they contain literally everything from where most of us have learnt ROS.***
